# Apply for Citizenship Online

Once you've obtained the earlier-mentioned documents, you are generally ready to apply for your child's citizenship online [with ICA](https://www.ica.gov.sg/).

**Note**: You can also apply for your child's passport altogether with the citizenship.

## Thoughts on the process

Overall, the online application was straightforward.
Once you have the documents required, it is a matter of just submitting them.

I applied in late September 2023, and received a confirmation of ICA's approval within 8 days (6 working days). It was really quick; I understand overseas application may be expedited.

The passport was ready much later, but it took less than 3 weeks for me in total.

I was able to pick up the passport & citizenship certificate at the embassy in Tokyo, Japan.

I do suspect I was lucky in terms of how long the overall process took.

If you are looking to obtain your child's passport soon for travels, do try to allow for delays.
