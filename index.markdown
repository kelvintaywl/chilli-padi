# About Chilli Padi

> Help for first-time Singaporean parents based overseas

My wife and I welcomed our first child in September 2023. He was born overseas (Japan).

As a first-time parent, I struggled with the paperwork to register my child's birth for both Japan and Singapore.

Chilli Padi is a collection of how-tos and whys re: what you need to register with Singapore, for your child born overseas.

If you are a first-time Singaporean parent like myself, you're not alone!
I hope this documentation helps you out.
