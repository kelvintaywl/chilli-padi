# Obtain Birth Certificate

I know what you're thinking.

_Duh. This is so obvious._

Before you navigate away, please hear me out below!

## Important: Registering Birth

Firstly, [Singapore **does not register** births of children born overseas](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/for-singapore-citizens/child-born-overseas#:~:text=Singapore%20Citizenship%20Application%20Singapore%20does%20not%20register%20births,in%20the%20country%2Fplace%20where%20the%20child%20is%20born.).

This means you would need to register the child's birth **in the country you are residing**. I assume the child is also born in this same country.

I also assume your child is delivered in a hospital.
As such, you can obtain the birth certificate from the hospital directly.

> ⚠️ If you are based in a country where English is not the primary language, you'd need to have a copy / translation of this birth certificate in **English**. We were lucky since our chosen hospital in Japan was able to provide an official English version too.

Next, with this birth certificate, you then need to register the birth at your city office.
(This is where your city office may also provide more information e.g., cash gifts, child support programmes etc.)

This is important as the Singapore government needs to confirm your child was indeed born overseas.
