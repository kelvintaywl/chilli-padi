# Translate Supporting Documents

You and your partner would need to submit supporting documents when filing for your child's Singaporean citizenship.

These include the following (non-exhaustive):

* Last 6 months' payslip
* Birth Certificate
* Employment Letter

If you are based in a country where English is the official language, congrats!

Otherwise, you would need to provide translations for these documents.

> ðŸ’¡
> Try to ask your HR if they can provide the employment letter in English. This way, you save the trouble of having to translate it.

We were able to "get away" with translating some of these documents ourselves.

_Your mileage may vary!_

However, be prepared to set aside **more time than you thought is needed** here;
Translating can take up some time indeed.
