# Take Passport Photo

This is a fun one!

Do note that the photo needs to meet specific requirements.
It would need to be 45mm x 35mm, on a white background.
You can find out more from [the guideline from ICA here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/photo-guidelines).

Here are a few ways to snap a passport-worthy picture for your child.

### Option A: Professional Photographer

This would generally mean a photo studio.
I feel this may be a little expensive for the occassion.
However, I suppose you can take this option, and make it a fun day out with the family!

### Option B: Photo Booth

As an adult, this would have been my go-to.
However, depending on your country of residence, these photo booths may generate passport photos of a different dimension to Singapore's requirements.

In addition, I am not 100% sure how best to keep the baby still for the cameras in these situations.

### Option C: Mobile App

There are many mobile apps that offer to (1) filter out the background, and (2) output based on required dimensions.

I found [one such app for my iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/passport-photo-maker-id-photo/id1437484611?l=en-US), and was able to output specifically to Singapore's requirements.

It was accepted by the Singapore government.
