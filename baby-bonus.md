# Get Your Baby Bonus!

The Singapore government would like to incentivize us to have kids.
The Baby Bonus scheme is one such strategy.

_Check for [eligibility here](https://www.babybonus-eservices.msf.gov.sg/parent-helper/)._

Briefly, you will receive cash gifts to your designated bank account.

In addition, you will be guided to set up a special bank account (Child Development Account or CDA) too.
This account is used to support your child's medical bills, healthcare products, and school fees.
Read more about CDA and Baby Bonus [here](https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/Pages/AboutUs.aspx).

## As your child grows up

I would like to visualize the usefulness of CDA via milestones of your child's growing-up.

Some important points:

1. The government **will match** your contribution to CDA (capped to a certain amount)
2. The CDA account will convert into a Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) **once your child turns 13**.
3. Approved institutions with PSEA are **[local schools](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/psea/funds-balance-and-usage) only**.

I understand the PSEA account will [earn interest of 2.5%](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/psea/overview). You can also further "top-up" the CDA or PSEA account.

Since you cannot draw cash out of CDA nor PSEA, I think you are trading the flexibility for the interest rates.

Hence, I think that CDA + PSEA is great for families that:

- have more than 1 child (PSEA account balance can be transferred to siblings)
- intend for their child to study in local institutions (e.g., NUS)

It is less appealing for families that:

- prefer to have more liquidity at hand for their child (e.g., to allow your child to study overseas)
- prefer investing your child's finance elsewhere with possible higher returns

## Personal Strategy

I would like to allow my child the financial flexibility of pursuing higher education at a school of their choice. This can be in or outside of Singapore.

Considering that PSEA accounts would be effective only after the child is at least 17 years old, I would rather invest the money into government savings bonds or so (with > 2.5% rate, after 10 years).
